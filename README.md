# Discriminative Learning 

This repo contains the code base for a series of discriminative learning models (implementing a simplified version of the Rescorla-Wagner learning rule) as reported in my PhD [thesis](https://languagelearninglabucl.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/vujovic_phd_final_20201005.pdf):
